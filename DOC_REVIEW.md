**README present:** ✅  
**docs/ directory present:** ✅  
**LICENSE present:** ✅  

## Findings
1. Baseline documentation exists; expand with API references, troubleshooting, and release notes per best practices.

General guidance: keep changelogs, architecture diagrams, and onboarding checklists synced with the code to avoid drift. Reference target language versions (Python 3.14, C23/C++23, Go 1.23, etc.) in the docs so expectations stay explicit.
